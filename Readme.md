\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello and welcome to my Python based WAR card game application. This simulates the card game WAR involving two players, where each player plays a card and the player with the higher card takes both cards and adds them to their deck. These rounds repeat until one player has all of the cards and that player is the winner. If both players play the same card at the same time (ie: Jack of spades vs Jack of diamonds) then WAR phase is simulated. In WAR phase each player has 3 cards face down, and one face up. The player with the stronger face up card takes all the cards in play and adds them to their deck.\
